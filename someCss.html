	<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS"> Rap is one of my favorite genre's of music. My favorite rap artists are Lil Yachty, Quavo, Kendrick Lamar, Post Malone, and Lil Pump. I have seen Lil Yachty live 3 times and I enjoy the message he sends to teenagers.</p> 
	<p style="font-family:Impact">My favorite songs are Boss by Lil Pump, Forever Young by Lil Yachty, Ball Player by Quavo, and Rockstar by Post Malone. I enjot listenening to music when I drive, do homework, or when I am hanging out with friends. Music is a great way to express your feelings and is a good way to relieve stress.</p>
